1. Why were the pings not successful?
The router's default gateways are not configured.


2.Were the pings successful? Explain.
The pings were successful because the R1 router ports are on, which created a traffic between PCA and PCB.


3.What is the name of the IOS image that the router is running?
System image file is "bootflash:/isr4300-universalk9.03.16.05.S.155-3.S5-ext.SPA.bin"
